Spine.js website.

Looking to contribute? This is a great place to start!

## Getting Started

The Spine.js Documentation website uses [wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) to generate static HTML for [Spine.js Docs](http://spine.github.io/)

### src/

the `src/` directory is where the magic happens. `cd` here and type `wintersmith preview` to start a local server and observe the changes you make to `src/`!

When ready to push your changes, make sure to run `wintersmith build` within the `src/` directory!
